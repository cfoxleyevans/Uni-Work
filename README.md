Uni-Work
========

Private repo for my personal use.

Serves two purposes.....

1) This will be a central place for me to place all of the code that i work on, 
   during my second and third years at Lancaster university. It means that i can employ version
   control on all of my code.

2) The second reason that i have decided to do this is so that i can combat any charges of plagiarism
   that a levied against me by being able to demonstarate the evolution of my code.
